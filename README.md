# Pantheon-Drug-inventory-and-supply-chain-tracking
This project is about a Drug inventory and supply chain tracking system that can help with keeping track of the stocks of drugs and their supply chain tracking.
This model is suitable for small and mid cap pharmaceutical companies that need help with keeping track of their drug stocks with live updates from the supply chain regarding sold stocks and further information.
The project uses MySQL Databases integrated into Python to keep track of the stock and modify any changes happening in both, the root-database as well as the stock-supply-database.
The supply chain tracking system uses simple Python scripts to ensure foolproof transfer of drug stocks without the need of any middle man, ensuring safe transactions.
